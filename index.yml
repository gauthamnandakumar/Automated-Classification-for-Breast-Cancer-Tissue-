title: Automated Diagnosis for Breast Cancer Tissue Type
Authors: Gautham Nandhakumar, Saiprasad Sankaranarayanan, Jayanthan Ramesh Vellore
Abstract: The correct diagnosis of breast cancer tissue type is one of the major problems
  in the medical field. From the literature it has been found that different pattern
  recognition techniques can help them to improve in this domain. Implementing automated
  diagnostic systems for breast cancer detection will be very beneficial for the doctors.
  The major objective of the paper is to create a breast cancer detection system that
  can be used by everyone. Breast cancer tissue type can be classified into Benign
  or Malignant based on 9 unique component scores. In our system, we use a PHP to
  create a web interface that collects these nine scores. The web interface is linked
  with MATLAB program that implements neural network based diagnostic system which
  is the backend of the project. Based on the nine scores implemented with the NN,
  the system calcualtes whether the tissue type is B or M. Existing data can also
  be viewed by the user when he/she inputs the sample number. This is done by integrating
  php and sqlite through matlab.
